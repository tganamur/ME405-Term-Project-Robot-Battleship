# Term-Project-Robot-Battleship-
Term project that I worked along with @jack33001 and @phillipshafik7 for our Mechantronics class at Cal Poly SLO (ME405). We designed, built and programmed a robot that would be able to a game of Battleship using ping pong balls as the projectiles. The project was programmed using Mircopython and ran on a STM32 Nucleo board. The repo contains all the driver files for motors and encoders used as well as the controllers that were created to control the motors. The repo also contains the main program file along with the game algorithm files used in automous mode (robot determined where to shoot based on user "hit" or "miss" commands).
